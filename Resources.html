			<p><strong>We've partnered with multiple organisations to be able to do what we do. To find out more what it exactly is, follow the links to those organisations, where it's best explained!</strong></p>
			
			<ul>
				<a name = "AmazonWatch"></a>
				<li>Amazon Watch</li>
				<p>We strive to keep the net amount of tree constant when deforestation takes place in the name of development. To achieve this goal, we work hand in hand with Amazon Watch. They are a foundation that protects rainforests. As the Butterfly Foundation's goal is to protect the habitat of butterflies, our goals align and so we work together.</p>

					<a class = "WhiteA2" href = "https://amazonwatch.org/">Pay them a visit!</a>
				</div>
				
				<a name = "MBF"></a>
				<li>Monarch Butterfly Fund</li>
				<p>Being an organisation much similar to us, we have many of the same goals and ambitions. And thus it makes absolute sense to partner with The Monarch Butterfly Fund, even though they only specialize in one species of butterflies. We love working with them!</p>
				<div class = "Centered">

				<div class = "Centered">
					<a class = "WhiteA2" href = "https://monarchconservation.org/">Show them some love!</a>
				</div>
				
				<a name = "XPrize"></a>
				<li>XPrize</li>
				<p>We wanted help from an organization that made breakthroughs possible. And there's no better than XPrize. They push humanity in the right track by funding the right technologies. Anyone from anywhere, if they've got a solid plan to solve a major issue, will end up in achieving their goal.</p>

				</div>
				
				<a name = "ADF"></a>
				<li>Arbor Day Foundation</li>
				<p>In our mission of keeping the net amount of tress constant, we also support increasing it! Arbor Day Foundation approached us to help us with that goal. They have planted more than 500 million trees in the last 50 years! If anyone is doing a good job, it's them. Visit their website to learn all about them.</p>

			<h2>Decrease In Butterflies</h2>
			<p>If you want to learn mor eabout the drop in butterfly numbers, we recommend this article. It goes into much depth and deeply analyses the issue, and provides solutions which we have adopted.</p>

				<a class = "WhiteA2" href = "https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2002551117">Article</a>

			<a name = "Decrease"></a>
			<h2>Lifecycle of Butterflies</h2>
			<p>While the description given by our website is straight forward, we recommend reading the simplified wikipedia article on it. While it is a simplified version, it holds a library worth of data on butterflies! Happy reading!</p>

			<div class = "Centered">
				<a class = "WhiteA2" href = "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly">Let's learn about butterflies!</a>
			</div>
			
			<a name = "Species"></a>
			<h2>Species of Butterflies</h2>
			<p>Wikepedia also has all the species of butterflies classified by any metric possible. While it may not be easy to read all that information, we hope it can be of help to the technical people out there!</p>
