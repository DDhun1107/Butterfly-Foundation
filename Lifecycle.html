			<p>Butterflies are quite remarkable in terms of their lifecycle. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They aren't like many other animals that either go through the process of emerging out of their egg, or being birthed by their parent. They undergo both!</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They first go through <strong>the gestation period</strong> inside an egg laid by their parent <strong>on a leaf or a flower</strong>. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eggs are usually laid during the <strong>summer, spring, or fall seasons.</strong> Butterflies usually do not lay eggs during the winter to <strong>avoid the egg from being damaged</strong> from wind or just the harsh cold conditions. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the egg is laid, <strong>the gestation period</strong>, that is, the time it takes for the egg to be ready to hatch is approximately <strong>four days.</strong> And after that, a tiny <strong>caterpillar</strong> will come out of the egg!</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caterpillars generally look like worms, but with legs. Most of the time, <strong>they have six legs</strong>, along with prolegs, that are <strong>limbs that also look like legs</strong>. They help caterpillars move around and attach to surfaces around themselves.<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sole purpose of caterpillars is <strong>to eat</strong>. That's what they do during the day, and also during the night. This is the <strong>reason as to why they get big so fast</strong>. Their diet is mostly leaves, which is why when farmers see caterpillars, they immediately go for a round of pesticides. While taking care of their crops is also important, the survival of caterpillars is also <strong>quintessential</strong>. <br/><br/>Caterpillars usually <strong>live for one to three weeks.</strong></p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After its time as a caterpillar, <strong>the insect settles down</strong> on a leaf or flower. It either <strong>secretes a silk like substance</strong> around itself and <strong>builds a cocoon,</strong> or its body develops a hard shell under its skin and the caterpillar sheds to reveal the ready-made cocoon. The cocoon is also known as the <strong>pupa.</strong> <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, the caterpillar experiences many changes, one of them is their physical appearence. They develop features such as large wings and a small body. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caterpillar's residence in the pupa may range from <strong>a few weeks to even a few years!</strong> Thus, this is the reasons why during their previous stage, that is the caterpillar stage, their only job is to eat and store as much energy as possible.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time arrives for our new buddy to come out of the pupa, it either <strong>eats it open,</strong> or <strong>the pupa breaks open</strong> as it moves. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There emerges the butterfly, slightly moist. During the next few hours, the <strong>butterfly will dry out and extend its wings</strong> for the first time. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, instinctively, it <strong>takes flight</strong> in search for flowers, mainly to <strong>feed on their nectar.</strong> Unlike its previous self, it <strong>cannot feed on leaves</strong>, so it has a only nectar diet and it loves it!<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of butterflies is <strong>to reproduce,</strong> and having wings means that they can <strong>fly to an appropriate location</strong> to lay eggs. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why butterflies matters so much is because <strong>they are <strong>important pollinators.</strong></strong> Without them, <strong>plants would not be able to produce fruits</strong> which eventually would <strong>prevent them from reproducing.</strong> Thus, the lack of butterflies in our ecology would <strong>lead to a huge downfall.</strong></p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As winter approaches, butterflies from the northern hemisphere <strong>fly to the south</strong>. This ensures that they have a <strong>consistent food source</strong>, and that they can <strong>escape the cold weather.</strong> <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butterflies not having a circulatory system means their <strong>body temperature solely depends on the surrounding environment.</strong> And thus, when the <strong>temperature dips</strong> too much, they have <strong>trouble flying</strong> and when its <strong>too hot</strong>, they will <strong>overheat and perish.</strong> <br/><br/>The chart below shows the approximate temperature pattern.</p>
