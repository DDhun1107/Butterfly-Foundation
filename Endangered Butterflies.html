			<p>While everything seems to be normal, <strong>it isn't.</strong><br><br> Yes, we can see butterflies quite regularly, but <strong>the numbers don't lie.</strong><br><br> Over the past four decades, <strong>more than four hundred and fifty</strong> species of butterflies have become extinct. That number in itself is saddening to think about. <br><br>Imagine how many of us haven't had the opportunity to see these butterfly species because <strong>we're too young</strong>, or how many of them are lost because <strong>we never had the chance to photograph them</strong>. <br><br>Now imagine, a few decades in the future, when the <strong>likelihood for our children to see a living butterfly</strong> flying around in a garden is zero. <br><br>That is <strong>a very grim future</strong> that awaits us, unless we take some <strong>much needed steps.</strong></p>

			<p>Global warming is real. <br><br>The earth is heating up, it <strong>has been heating up for a century</strong>, and it will <strong>keep on heating up</strong> if we don't continue to work on it. <br><br>And one of its devastating effects is that <strong>animals that can no longer live</strong> in such temperatures will perish. This is actively happening with butterflies. Being quite an unadaptable animal, they are dying off. <br><br>While migration is still happening, there will be a time when <strong>there won't be a place to migrate to</strong>.</p>

			<p>As shown in the graph above, the percentage of butterflies has <strong>diminished to 60%</strong> of what it was before the 1970s. Watch the video below to learn more about it.</p>

			<p>The aim of our foundation is to raise funds and take action along with other organisations in order to save the lovely butterflies. If nobody can help, we take matters into our own hands.</p>
